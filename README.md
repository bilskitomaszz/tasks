<b>Prerequisites to successfully run the tests:</b>
- Chrome browser version 78,
- Selenium WebDriver 3.7.1,
- Java SE Development Kit 8,
- Java integrated development environment (IDE) (Eclipse/Intellij etc),
- All of the tests should be performed on Macbook (otherwise the ChromeWebdriver requires an update in both - code and file).
